# simple-chatbot
This is a simple chatbot built using Python and two libraries: NLTK and Scikit-learn. It uses the TF-IDF algorithm and cosine similarity to generate responses based on user input.

## Installation
To run this chatbot, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You also need to install the following libraries:

NLTK
Scikit-learn
You can install these libraries using pip. Open a terminal and run the following commands:

```
pip install nltk
pip install scikit-learn
```

## Usage
To use the chatbot, run the chatbot.py file in your Python environment. The chatbot will greet you and ask how it can assist you. You can type any text you want, and the chatbot will generate a response based on your input.

To stop the chatbot, type "bye" or "exit".

## Contributing
This chatbot is a simple example that can be improved in many ways. You can contribute to this project by adding more data, improving the preprocessing and tokenization, adding more advanced NLP techniques, or implementing a different algorithm for generating responses.
